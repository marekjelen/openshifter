# OpenShifter
Tool to provision and bootstrap an OpenShift cluster in the cloud.

## How to run OpenShifter

1. Create working directory, e.g. ~/deployer.

1. Add into this directory a private key that will be used for connecting to the server with the name `private.key`.

   > This key can be any key you want to use - it is not tied to any specific Google account. Can be your personal key or one that you just create for using this tool

1. Create the definition file, e.g. `cluster01.yml` in the same directory.
The file name will be the prefix of the DNS name for your cluster.

   > In the definition file you'll need to add the public part of the key you added before, so that the tool can connect.

1. Execute openshifter

   ```
   docker run -ti -v ~/deployer:/root/data docker.io/mjelen/openshifter create/destroy/cleanup cluster01
   ```

   > To be able to pull down the openshifter image from gitlab you need to be in the osevg organization, and you'll be required to execute __docker login registry.gitlab.com__ with your gitlab credentials.

## Providers

### Google Compute Engine [gce]

Currently most stable and useful for normal installation and for `oc cluster up`.

[Create new ServiceAccount](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) and assign permission

* Project -> Owner

finally download the credentials as JSON file and save them to your working directory.

Set up your DNS

* Open the Google Cloud Console and go to Networking -> [Cloud DNS](https://console.cloud.google.com/networking/dns/zones)
* Register new zone for your domain
* Configure your domain with at your registrar as described under "Registrar setup" (link in top right corner)

Update your definition file

```yaml
provider: gce                 # Use GCE as provider

gce:                          # required, configure GCE provider
  project: <project id>       # required, ID of the project to use
  account: <the JSON file>    # required, name of the JSON file with account credentials
  dns: <zone name>            # required, zone name to use in Cloud DNS  
  zone: us-west1-a            # optional, zone to use
  region: us-west1            # optional, region to use, if not set, is calculated by stripping last segment from zone
  machine: n1-standard-1      # optional, machine type to use
```

### Linode [linode]

Mostly useful for quick `oc cluster up` installations.

Update your definition file

```yaml
provider: linode              # required, Use Linode as provider

linode:                       # required, Configure Linode provider
  key: <linode key>           # required, Linode API kay
  datacenter: dallas          # optional, Datacenter (dallas, fremont, atlanta, newark, london, tokyo, singapore, frankfurt, shinagawa1)
  plan: 8192                  # optional, Memory size (2048, 4096, 8192, 12288, 24576, 49152, 65536, 81920, 122880)

```

## Installers
OpenShifter provides different ways to install your cluster.

### Ansible [ansible]
When this installer is configured, it will use __ansible__ to do the installation of the cluster. This is required for multi nodes cluster.

### oc cluster up [ocu]
When this installer is configured, it will use __oc cluster up__ to do the installation of the cluster. This cluster will be a one node all-in-one cluster. This installer is much faster than ansible, but provides a limited set of functionalities, so it's a good option for test clusters.


## Troubleshooting

* If when you do the provisioning of the cluster, you get this error:

  ```
  com.google.api.client.auth.oauth2.TokenResponseException: 400 Bad Request
  {
    "error" : "invalid_grant",
    "error_description" : "Invalid JWT: Token must be a short-lived token and in a reasonable timeframe"
  }
  ```

  The problem might be related to an out-of-time-synch docker daemon. (This happens quite often in macOS).
  Just restart the daemon.

* If you get an error about not finding the Main class when running on Linux:

 ```
 Error: Could not find or load main class eu.mjelen.openshifter.cli.Main
 ```

 Then you should add the :Z flag to your volumes to set the correct SELinux:

 ```
 docker run -ti -v ~/deployer:/root/data:Z registry.gitlab.com/osevg/openshifter create cluster01.yml
 ```

## Developer information

If would like to create the container image associated with this project there
are a few prerequisite steps that must be followed beforehand:

1. ensure that the [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) build tool is
   installed on your system

1. run the following command to build the project locally:

   `mvn -P release clean package`

1. when that is finished you will have built the necessary Java JAR files and
   the project is ready to constructed into a container with the following
   command:

   `docker build -t openshifter .`

You will now have an image named `openshifter` in your docker registry, ready
for deployment as described in the previous sections.
